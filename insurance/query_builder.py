"""
Simple class for constructing queries for interacting with the Sqlite3 DB
This db will contain a table called policies, and the below class will construct
queries based on what is passed into the GET call for the insurance.query API

TODO(jae.han):
    - Ideally a query builder would be used, since SQLite does not excel at
    dynamic querying.
    - However due to time constraints, I was not able to finish this portion.
